## How To Use Dyson!
Start with `/dyson` for a general idea of how to use Dyson. This command lists all of Dyson's commands, and has buttons that roll the most common polyhedral dice.

## Roll Dice! üé≤
Use `/roll` to roll dice up to 1000 dice with up to 1000 sides. This command has a total of 6 fields, 4 of which are optional. Dyson will send an error should you enter a non-number in these fields. Keep in mind this command is not limited to traditional polyhedral dice. You could, for instance, roll a d31, a d608, a d999, and so on. This is meant to allow for easy rolling no matter what system is being played, or what dice it uses. You can access optional fields after typing `/roll` by hitting tab until they appear in the window above. Then, simply click the optional fields you wish to use for your roll. 

‚Ä¢ **Amount.** In the *Amount* field, put the number of dice you wish to roll (between 1 and 1000). <br>
‚Ä¢ **D.** In the *d* field, put the number of sides your dice/die has (between 2 and 1000). So, if you wanted to roll 3d6, you would put 3 in the *Amount* field, 6 in the *d* field, and hit Enter.  <br>
‚Ä¢ **Add (Optional).** Add a number to your roll by placing it in the *add* optional field.  <br>
‚Ä¢ **Subtract (Optional).** Subtract a number from your roll by placing it in the *subtract* optional field. <br>
‚Ä¢ **Multiply (Optional).** Multiply your roll by a number by placing it in the *multiply* optional field. <br>
‚Ä¢ **Divide (Optional).** Divide your roll by a number by placing it in the *divide* optional field. <br>
